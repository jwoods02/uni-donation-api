<!--
this is the total donations template.  Access with "#total-template .total" to get the <span> element.

The Javascript will then target the <h1> element.

We don't want the outer element as it has the style attribute on it.
-->

<section class = "total-template" style = "display: none !important;" >
    <span class="total">
        <h1 class="total-value"></h1>
    </span>
</section >
