<!--
this is the table template.  Access with ".activity-table-template .activity-table" to get the <table> element.

We don't want the outer element as it has the style attribute on it.

<section class = "activity-table-template" style = "display: none !important;" >
        <table class="activity-table" border="1">
                <tbody class="activity-table-body">
                </tbody>
        </table >
</section >
